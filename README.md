For the students at IIT Madras, where academic rigour and a packed schedule are the norms, using PlanIT â€” a calendar app designed for effective time management - is the way. PlanIT helps students to juggle their intense coursework, extracurricular commitments and social activities by consolidating all their schedules and deadlines into one easily accessible platform where students can add events which are scheduled by the technical and cultural heads, professors and CRs, prioritizing what to add to their personal calendar and what to be reminded of. This app addresses common issues faced by students such as the challenge of coordinating multiple commitments and realising changes in schedule notified by the respective Professors or TAs.
